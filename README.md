# The CCPG Benchmark

A Cloth-Changing Benchmark for Person re-identification and Gait Recognition (CCPG).

## Highlights in CCPG

(1) It provides 200 identities and over 16K sequences are captured indoors and outdoors.

(2) Each identity has seven different cloth-changing statuses, which is never seen in previous datasets.

(3) RGB and silhouettes version data are both available for research purposes **ONLY**.

(1) It provides 200 identities, including over 16K sequences captured both indoors and outdoors.

(2) Each identity has seven different cloth-changing statuses, which is a feature not previously seen in other datasets.

(3) It includes both RGB and silhouette version data, but it is essential to note that it is **ACADEMIC USE ONLY**.

## Examples of CCPG
