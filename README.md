# The CCPG Benchmark

A Cloth-Changing Benchmark for Person re-identification and Gait recognition (CCPG).

## Highlights in CCPG

(1) it provides 200 identities and over 16K sequences are captured indoors and outdoors,

(2) each identity has seven different cloth-changing statuses, which is never seen in previous datasets,

(3) RGB and silhouettes version data are both available for research purposes **ONLY**.

## Examples of CCPG

#### Silhoutte
<img src="./assets/all.png" width = "600" height = "150"/>

#### RGB
<img src="./assets/all_v2.jpg" width = "600" height = "600"/>

#### Clothes Variation
