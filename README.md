# The CCPG Benchmark

A Cloth-Changing Benchmark for Person Re-identification and Gait Recognition (CCPG).

## Highlights in CCPG

(1) It provides 200 identities, including over 16K sequences captured both indoors and outdoors.

(2) Each identity has seven different cloth-changing statuses, which is a feature not previously seen in other datasets.

(3) The dataset includes **RGB**, **silhouette**, and **pose** data versions, but it is essential to note that it is **ACADEMIC USE ONLY**. 

## Examples of CCPG

#### Silhouette
<img src="./assets/all.png" width = "600" height = "150"/>

#### RGB
<img src="./assets/all_v2.jpg" width = "600" height = "600"/>

#### Clothes Variation
<img src="./assets/cloth-changing-v4.jpg" width = "600" height = "300"/>
